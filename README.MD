Great! Based on your description and the variables, I’ll update the README file to include an explanation of the variables used in the project.

# Temporary Variables NixOS Project

This project provides a package for managing temporary variables and resources in a NixOS environment. The package is divided into three main components: **scripts**, **temporary**, and **service**.

## Overview

This project creates and manages temporary files and variables in a NixOS environment, focusing on automating cleanup processes. It includes:

1. **Scripts**: Basic executable scripts for various tasks.
2. **Temporary**: Scripts that create temporary files and directories, automatically deleting them when the calling process completes.
3. **Service**: A service that runs on boot, ensuring any leftover temporary resources from unexpected shutdowns are cleaned up.  The service is currently untested and should be considered broken.

## Installation

To install this package, use Nix's flake support. Clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#
```

Alternatively, include this package in your system’s configuration by adding it to your NixOS configuration.

## Usage

### Scripts

The **scripts** section contains standalone executable scripts that perform various tasks. To use them, simply call the script from your terminal:

```bash
./path-to-script/script-name
```

### Temporary

The **temporary** scripts are similar to the regular scripts, but they manage the creation of temporary files and directories. These scripts monitor the process that called them and clean up the temporary resources once the process finishes.

```bash
./path-to-script/temporary-script-name
```

If the calling process crashes or does not terminate properly, the service will clean up any remaining temporary files on the next boot.

### Service

The **service** is designed to handle resource cleanup in case of unexpected shutdowns. It is typically triggered during system bootup to ensure any temporary files or directories left by the **temporary** scripts are deleted.

To enable the service, add the following to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.temp-resource-cleaner.enable = true;
```

This will ensure the service runs on every system reboot.

## Variables

Here is an explanation of all the variables used in this project:

- **at**: Points to the `at` command (`/run/wrappers/bin/at`) for scheduling tasks.
- **debug**: Defaults to `/dev/null`, used for discarding debug output.
- **invalid-script-throw**: Throws an error when an invalid script is detected, providing a specific message based on the script type and the value encountered.
- **invalid-temporary-throw**: Similar to `invalid-script-throw`, this handles errors for invalid temporary resources, specifying the error type and associated value.
- **mask-reference**: Defines the pattern for matching temporary resources (`/tmp/*.resource`).
- **out**: Represents an output identifier, used to verify output consistency.
- **resource**: Points to a resource hash that uniquely identifies the resource created.
- **secondary**: A placeholder for secondary configurations or settings, which is empty by default (`{}`).
- **scripts**: Stores the scripts configuration, defaulting to `secondary`.
- **target**: Specifies a target identifier used to manage temporary resources.
- **temporary**: Holds temporary resource information, starting as an empty set.
- **temporary-hold**: A flag used to control the delay or hold state of temporary resources, with a default value of `0`.
- **temporary-init-error-code**: The error code (`64`) used if initializing temporary resources fails.
- **temporary-resource-directory**: The path to create a temporary resource directory, using `mktemp` (`${ pkgs.coreutils }/bin/mktemp --directory -t XXXXXXXX.resource`).
- **temporary-broken-directory**: The path to create a "broken" temporary directory for failed resources, using `mktemp` in dry-run mode (`${ pkgs.coreutils }/bin/mktemp --dry-run -t XXXXXXXX.broken`).

These variables allow the system to manage temporary resources, monitor processes, and clean up resources automatically upon process completion or system reboot.

### Key Variables
Most of the variables have sensible default values and do not need to be changed.
#### mask-reference and temporary-resource-directory and ${ temporary-broken-directory }
These variables probably do not need to be changed but if they are changed they should be changed in combination.
If we run `${ temporary-resource-directory }` repeatedly and want to find the invocations then `${ mask-reference }` should find all of them without finding any of the invocations of `${ temporary-broken-directory }'.
#### secondary
We should definitely redefine.
This will be defined in the components.
#### scripts
We should definitely redefine.
This will be one of our two most important variables.
When we redefine this, we can provide scripts.
These scripts can use the given secondary and a variable `target`.
`target` holds the value of the temporary resource created.
#### temporary
We should definitely redefine.
This will be the second of our two most important variables.
When we redefine this, we can provide temporary.
Each lambda we contribute provides a temporary executable.
The lambda depends on scripts (previously defined).
We can specify an init script and a release script (or leave one or both empty).
The temporary executable will start by executing the init script.
We will monitor the calling process.
When it completes, we will call the release script.
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests on GitHub.

~~This project uses `nix flake check` to run automated tests.~~
~~There are two known kludges with the automated tests.~~
~~For this reason, the service should be considered untested.~~

Note:
This section is temporary and will be removed once the issue with github actions is resolved.
We can use

``time timeout 60s nix flake check --no-write-lock-file --show-trace && git commit -am "" --allow-empty --allow-empty-message``

to test our code on our system.
Whatever we write will complete in 1 minute or less.
(If we inadvertently write code that hangs the system, it will fail in one minute.)
If it works it will commit the changes.
If it does not work it will provide a detailed trace of what went wrong.
It will provide a measure of the time it took.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues, please open a GitHub issue with detailed information about the problem.

### Feature Requests

If you have ideas for new features or improvements, open an issue or submit a pull request.
